## Welcome to the BHoM!

The BHoM (Buildings and Habitats object Model) is a collaborative project for the AEC (Architecture, Engineering and Construction) industry that aims to improve how we design the Built Environment and human Habitats.

BHoM is a collection of schemas, functionality and interoperability infrastructure, developed with the aim of improving the way we work and communicate in AEC. BHoM is crafted as transdisciplinary, software-agnostic and office/region/country-invariant. BHoM is powered by an active, diverse community and a wide range of contributors.  
The whole BHoM project uses an open-source model for project architecture, co-creation and planning. Please explore, experiment and contribute to both the source code and the documentation! Open-source  means we can feed off and pool our disparate knowledge, experience and expertise towards a common goal â€“ better design and a better Built Environment and Habitats for everyone.

#### Technical philosophy of the BHoM

The BHoM integrates concepts from different languages, coding environments and platforms. It's designed to be compatible with both visual flow-based programming (e.g. [Grasshopper](https://simplyrhino.co.uk/3d-modelling-software/grasshopper), Excel) and programming (in particular, C#). This is to integrate well in existing workflows of professionals in the AEC industry, regardless of their level of computational proficiency. BHoM aims to combine the work of professional programmers with the valuable efforts of computational designers/engineers/architects and scripters, all in the same ecosystem.
