## Welcome to the BHoM!

<!--

The BHoM (Buildings and Habitats object Model) is a collaborative computational development project for the AEC (Architecture, Engineering and Construction) industry â€“ the Built Environment.

BHoM is a collection of schemas, functionality and conversions industry, with the aim of improving the way we work and communicate in AEC.

BHoM is crafted as transdisciplinary, software-agnostic and office/region/country-invariant, and therefore would be nothing without our active community and wide range of contributors.

The whole BHoM project uses an open-source model for project architecture, co-creation and planning. So explore, experiment and contribute to both the source code and the wiki.  
Sharing and building our code together in this open-source type approach means we can feed off and pool our disparate knowledge, experience and expertise towards a common goal â€“ better design.

### Technical philosophy of the BHoM

The BHoM integrates concepts from different languages, coding environments and platforms. It's designed to be compatible with both visual flow-based programming (e.g. [Grasshopper](https://simplyrhino.co.uk/3d-modelling-software/grasshopper), Excel) and programming (e.g. in particular, C#).

Thes is to integrate well in the workflow of any professional in the AEC industry, regardless of their level of computational proficiency: BHoM is a platform for combining the efforts of the professional programmer with those of any enthusiastic scripter/computational designer/engineer/architect, all in the same ecosystem.
